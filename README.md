An AI-powered virtual voice assistant built using Python, designed to enable hands-free, intelligent human–computer interaction through speech recognition, natural language processing, automation, and API-based information retrieval.

This project is based on the research paper “AI-Powered Virtual Voice Assistant: A Multi-Modal Intelligent Automation System Using Speech Recognition and Python” and demonstrates real-world applications of AI-driven automation.

📌 Features

🎤 Speech Recognition – Converts real-time voice input into text

🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Extracts user intent from spoken commands

🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS) – Provides natural voice responses

🌐 Web Automation – Automates browser tasks using Selenium

☁️ API Integration – Fetches live data like:

Weather updates

News headlines

💻 System Automation – Open applications, files, and perform system-level tasks

👤 Personalized Responses – Adapts output based on user preferences

🧩 Modular Architecture – Easy to extend and scale

🏗️ System Architecture

The assistant follows a modular multi-layer architecture:

Input Layer – Captures voice using microphone

Speech Recognition Layer – Converts speech to text

NLP Processing Layer – Analyzes text and extracts intent

Command Mapping Engine – Maps intent to actions

Automation Layer – Executes system and web tasks

API Layer – Retrieves real-time information

Text-to-Speech Layer – Generates spoken responses

This design ensures high responsiveness, reliability, and scalability.
